          Crafting Web Applications with Passion and Precision

          As a dedicated front-end developer, I thrive on transforming ideas
          into engaging web experiences. With a background in design and a
          passion for coding, I combine aesthetics and functionality to create
          user-centric websites. I have a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and
          JavaScript, along with experience using frameworks like React and
          Tailwind CSS. My journey in web development began with a fascination
          for how technology shapes our daily lives, and it has evolved into a
          commitment to deliver high-quality digital solutions.
